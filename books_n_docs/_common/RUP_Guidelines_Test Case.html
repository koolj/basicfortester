<p>Nothing has a greater effect on the end-user's satisfaction with the software
than a clear view of what the end-user expects so that those expectations can be
verified and validated. Test cases reflect the requirements that are to be
verified. Verifying these requirements, however, may be done differently and by
different testers. For example, executing the software to verify its function
and performance may be done by a tester using automated test techniques, the
shut-down sequence of a computer system may be done by manual test and
observation, while market share and sales, (also product requirements), will be
done by measuring product and competitive sales.</p>
<p>Since you may not be able to (or be responsible to) verify all requirements,
it is critical for the success of your project to select the most appropriate or
critical ones requirements for test. The requirements you choose to verify will
be a balance between the cost, risk, and necessity of having the requirement
verified.</p>
<p>Identifying the test cases is important for several reasons.
</p><ul>
  <li>Test cases form the foundation on which to design and develop Test Scripts.</li>
  <li>The "depth" of the testing is proportional to the number of test
    cases. Greater confidence in the quality of the product and test process is
    gained when the number of test cases increases, since each test case
    reflects a different scenario, condition, or flow through the product.</li>
  <li>A principal measure of the completeness of test is requirements-based
    coverage, based on the of the number test cases identified, implemented, and
    / or executed. A statement such as "95 percent of our critical test
    cases have been executed and verified" is more significant than stating
    "We're 95 percent of the way through our tests."</li>
  <li>The scale of the test effort is proportional to the number of test cases.
    With a comprehensive breakdown of test cases, the timing of succeeding
    stages of the test cycle can be more accurately estimated.</li>
  <li>The kinds of test design and development, and the resources needed are
    largely governed by the test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test cases are often categorized or classified by the type of test or
requirement for test they are associated with, and will vary accordingly. Best
practice is to develop at least two test cases for each requirement for test:
</p><ul>
  <li>a test case to demonstrate the requirement has been achieved, often
    referred to as a positive test case,</li>
  <li>another test case, reflecting an unacceptable, abnormal, or unexpected
    condition or data, to demonstrate that the requirement is only achieved
    under the desired condition, referred to as a negative test cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Deriving Test Cases from Use Cases">Deriving Test Cases from Use
Cases</a> <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/modguide/md_tstcs.htm#Top" "=""><img src="./RUP_Guidelines_Test Case_files/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Test cases for functional testing are derived from the target-of-test's use
cases (see <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/artifact/ar_uc.htm" "="">Artifact: Use Case</a>). Test cases
should be developed for each use-case scenario. The use-case scenarios are
identified by describing the paths through the use case that traverse the basic
flow and alternate flows start to finish through the use case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the diagram below, for example, each of the different paths through a use
case reflecting the basic and alternate flows, are represented with the arrows.
The basic flow, represented by the straight, black-line is the simplest path
through the use case. Each alternate flow begins with the basic flow and then,
dependent upon a specific condition, the alternate flow is executed. Alternate
flows may rejoin the basic flow (alternate flows 1 and 3), may originate from
another alternate flow (alternate flow 2), or may terminate the use case without
rejoining a flow (alternate flows 2 and 4).</p>

basic flow and then combining the basic flow with alternate flows, the following
use-case scenarios can be identified:&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">NOTE:&nbsp; For simplicity, Scenarios 5, 6, and 8 only depict a
single execution of the loop indicated by Alternate flow
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deriving the test cases for each scenario is done by identifying the specific
condition that will cause that specific use-case scenario to be executed.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the use case depicted in the diagram above stated the
following for Alternate Flow 3:</p>
<p>"This flow of events occurs if the dollar amount entered in Step 2
above, "Enter Withdraw Amount" is greater than the current account
balance. The system displays a warning message and then rejoins the basic flow
at Step 2 "Enter Withdraw Amount" above, where the bank customer can
enter a new withdrawal amount."</p>
<p>With this information, you can begin to identify the test cases needed to
execute the alternate flow 3:

case, there is a test case ID, Condition (or description), and all the data
elements participating in the test case (as input or already in the database),
and expected result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin developing the matrix, start by identifying what data elements are
required to execute the use-case scenarios. Then, for each scenario, identify at
least test case that contains the appropriate condition to execute the scenario.
For example, in the matrix below, V (valid) is used to indicate this condition
must be VALID for the basic flow to execute and I (invalid) is used to indicate
the condition which will invoke the desired alternate flow.&nbsp;In the table
below, "n/a" indicates that this condition is not applicable to the
test case.</p>

<p>In the matrix above, the six test cases execute the four scenarios. For the
Basic Flow, test case CW1 above is known as a positive test case. It executes
the Basic Flow path through the use case without any deviations. Comprehensive
testing of the Basic Flow must include negative test cases to ensure that the
Basic Flow is taken only when the conditions are correct. These negative test
cases are represented by test cases CW2 - 6 (the shaded cell indicates the
condition needed to execute the alternate flows).&nbsp;While CW2 - 6 are
negative test cases for the Basic Flow, they are positive test cases for
Alternate flows 2 - 4, and there is at least one negative test case each of
these Alternate Flows (CW1 - the Basic Flow).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 4 is an example where having just one positive and one negative test
case per scenario is not sufficient. To thoroughly test Scenario 4 - Incorrect
PIN, at least three positive test cases (to invoke Scenario 4) are needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the incorrect PIN is entered and there are tries left and this Alternate
    Flow rejoins the Basic Flow Step 3 - Enter PIN)</li>
  <li>the incorrect PIN is entered and there are no remaining tries left and
    this Alternate Flow then retains the card and terminates the use case.</li>
  <li>the CORRECT PIN is entered when there are no remaining tries left.&nbsp;
    This Alternate Flow rejoins the Basic Flow at Step 5 - Enter Amount.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice, that in the above matrix, no actual values were entered for the
conditions (data). An advantage of creating the test case matrix in this manner
is that it is easy to see what conditions are being tested. It is also very easy
to determine if sufficient test cases have been identified, since you only need
to look at Vs and Is (or as done here - shaded cells). Looking at the above
table, there are several conditions for which there is no shaded cell,
therefore, we are missing test cases, such as for Scenario 6 - No Account or
Incorrect Account Type and Scenario 7 - Insufficient Account Balance.</p>
<p>One all the test cases have been identified, they should be reviewed and
validated to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and eliminate redundant or
equivalent test cases. See <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/activity/chklists/ck_tstcs.htm" "="">Checkpoints:
Test Case</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Upon approval of the test cases, the actual data values can be identified (in
the test case implementation matrix) and the test data built (see <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/modguide/md_tstdta.htm" "="">Guidelines:
Test Data</a> for more information regarding test data).</p>

</p><p>The test cases above are only a few of the test cases needed to verify the
Cash Withdraw Use Case for this iteration. Other test cases needed include:
</p><ul>
  <li>Scenario 6 - No Account or Incorrect Account Type: Account not found or
    available</li>
  <li>Scenario 6 - No Account or Incorrect Account Type: Account does not allow
    withdraws</li>
  <li>Scenario 7 - Insufficient Account Balance: Amount requested greater than
    amount in account.</li>
</ul>
<p>In future iterations, when other flows are implemented, test cases will be
needed for:
</p><ul>
  <li>Invalid cards (card is reported lost, stolen, is not from an accepted
    bank, has a damaged stripe, etc.)</li>
  <li>Inability to read a card (card reader is jammed, off-line, or
    malfunctioning)</li>
  <li>Account is closed, frozen, or otherwise unavailable</li>
  <li>Amount in ATM is insufficient or incapable of creating requested amount
    (different than CW3, in that one denomination is out, but not all)</li>
  <li>Incapable of contacting banking system for approval</li>
  <li>Bank network goes off line, or power failure mid-transaction</li>
</ul>
<p>When identifying functional test cases, ensure the following:
</p><ul>
  <li>sufficient test cases, positive and negative, have been identified for
    each use-case scenario&nbsp;</li>
  <li>test cases address any business rules implemented by the use cases,
    ensuring that there are test cases inside, outside, and at the boundary
    condition / value for the business rule</li>
  <li>test cases address any sequencing of events or actions, such as those
    identified in the sequence diagrams in the design model, or user interface
    object states or conditions.</li>
  <li>test cases address any special requirements defined for the use case, such
    minimum/maximum performance, sometimes combined with minimum/maximum loads
    or data volumes during the execution of the use cases.</li>

<p>The primary input for performance test cases are the Supplementary
Specifications which contain the non-functional requirements (see <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/artifact/ar_sspec.htm" "="">Artifact:
Supplementary Specifications</a>). Use the following guidelines when deriving
test cases for performance test:
</p><ul>
  <li>ensure there is at least one test case identified for each statement in
    the supplementary specification which states a performance criteria.
    Performance criteria are usually expressed as time per transaction, number
    of transactions / users, or percentiles.</li>
  <li>ensure there is at least one test case identified for each critical use
    case. Critical use cases are those identified in the above statements and /
    or in the workload analysis document (see <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/artifact/ar_wlmod.htm" "="">Artifact:
    Workload Analysis Document</a>) that must be evaluated using performance
    measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with test cases for functional tests, there will typically be more than
one test case per use case / requirement. It is more common that there will be
one test case that is below the performance threshold value another at the
threshold value, and a third test case above the threshold value.</p>
<p>In addition to the above performance criteria, ensure that you identify the
specify conditions that affect response times, including:
</p><ul>
  <li>Size of the database - how many records exist?</li>
  <li>Workload - number and type of simultaneous end-users, number and type of
    simultaneous transactions being performed</li>
  <li>Environment characteristics (hardware, netware, software configuration)</li>
</ul>
<p>Capture test cases for performance test in matrices similar to those used for
function test.</p>

<p>Actors and use cases describe the interaction between external users of the
system and the actions performed by the system to yield a value to a particular
actor. Complex systems contain many actors and it is critical that we develop
test cases to ensure that only those actors specified to execute the use cases
can do so. This is especially true if there are differences in the use case flow
of events based upon actor type.</p>
<p>For example, in the ATM use cases, different use case flow of events may be
executed for the actor "Bank Customer" if their card and account is
from the bank that owns the ATM versus the "Bank Customer" who uses a
bank card (and account) from a competing bank, or tries to use a
non-participating bank card.</p>
<p>Follow the same guidelines as listed above for functional test cases.</p>

for Configuration Tests</a> <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/modguide/md_tstcs.htm#Top" "=""><img src="./RUP_Guidelines_Test Case_files/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In typical distributed systems there can be many allowed combinations of
hardware and software that will be supported. Testing should be performed to
verify that the target-of-test functions or performs acceptably in different
configurations, such as with different operating systems, browsers, or CPU
speeds. Furthermore, testing also needs to cover combinations of components to
uncover defects that come from interactions of the different components, for
example, ensuring that the version of DLLs installed by one application do not
conflict the versions of the same DLLs expected by another application.</p>
<p>To derive test cases for configuration testing, use the following guidelines:
</p><ul>
  <li>Ensure there is at least one test case identifying each critical
    configuration. This is done by identifying the required hardware and
    software configurations for the target-of-test's environment and
    prioritizing the configurations, ensuring the most common ones are tested
    first, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Printer support</li>
      <li>Network connections - local and wide area networks</li>
      <li>Server configurations - server drivers, server hardware</li>
      <li>Other software installed on the desktop and / or servers</li>
      <li>Software versions for all installed software</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure there is at least one test case for each configuration likely to
    have problems. These may include:
    <ul>
      <li>Hardware with the lowest performance.</li>
      <li>Co-resident software that has a history of compatibility problems.</li>
      <li>Clients accessing the server over slowest possible LAN/WAN connection.</li>
      <li>Insufficient resources (slow CPU speed, minimum memory or resolution,
        disk space, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Deriving Test Cases for Installation Tests">Deriving Test Cases for

<p>Installation testing needs to verify that the target-of-test can be installed
under all possible installation scenarios. Installation scenarios may include
installing the target-of-test for the first time, or installing a newer version
or build of the target-of-test (onto a machine containing the older version).
Install testing should also ensure that the target-of-test performs acceptably
when abnormal conditions are encountered, such as insufficient disk space.</p>
<p>The test cases should cover installation scenarios for the software
including:
</p><ul>
  <li>Distribution media, for example, diskettes, CD-ROM, or file server.</li>
  <li>New installation.</li>
  <li>Complete installation.</li>
  <li>Custom installations.</li>
  <li>Upgrade installations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation programs for client-server software have a specialized set of
test cases. Unlike host-based systems, the installation program is typically
divided between the server and the client. Therefore, it is important that
installation testing perform the installation of all components of the
target-of-test, including the client, middle tiers, and servers.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should find all the necessary input to derive test cases in the
Use-Case Model, the Design Model, and the Supplementary Specification artifacts.
It is, however, not uncommon that you at this point need to complement what is
found there.</p>
<p>Examples would be:
</p><ul>
  <li>Test cases for Operational Tests (to verify that the software works when
    in use for a "long time" between failures).</li>
  <li>Test cases that investigate performance bottlenecks, volume capabilities
    of the system, or stress the target-of-test to failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can find these test cases by creating variants or
aggregates of the test cases you've derived from those previously identified.</p>

<p>Unit testing requires testing both the unit's internal structure and its
behavioral characteristics. Testing the internal structure requires a&nbsp;
knowledge of how the unit is implemented, and tests based upon this knowledge
are known as white-box tests. Testing a unit's behavioral characteristics
focuses on the external observable behaviors of the unit without knowledge or
regard its implementation. Tests based upon this approach are referred to as
black-box tests. Deriving test cases based upon both approaches are described
below.</p>
<h4><a name="WhiteBox_tests"></a><a name="XE_white-box_test__of_units">White-Box 
  Tests</a> <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/modguide/md_tstcs.htm#Top" "=""><img src="./RUP_Guidelines_Test Case_files/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Theoretically, you should test every possible path through the code.
Achieving such a goal, in all but very simple units, is either impractical or
almost impossible. At the very least you should exercise every <strong>decision-to-decision
path</strong> (DD-path) at least once, resulting in executing all statements at
least once. A decision is typically an if-statement, and a DD-path is a path
between two decisions.</p>
<p>To get this level of test coverage, it is recommended that you choose test
data so that every decision is evaluated in every possible way. Toward that end,
the test cases should make sure that:
</p><ul>
  <li>Every Boolean expression is evaluated to <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>.
    For example the expression (a&lt;3) OR (b&gt;4) evaluates to four
    combinations of <strong>true</strong>/<strong>false</strong></li>
  <li>Every infinite loop is exercised at least zero times, once, and more than
    once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use code-coverage tools to identify the code not exercised by your white box
testing. Reliability testing should be done simultaneously with your white-box
testing.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">Assume that you perform a structure test on a function <strong>member</strong>
in the class <strong>Set of Integers. </strong>The test - with the help of a
binary search - checks whether the set contains a given integer.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="./RUP_Guidelines_Test Case_files/untst001.gif" width="301" height="200"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The member function and its corresponding flowchart.
Dotted arrows illustrate how you can use two test cases to execute all the
statements at least once.</p>
<p>Theoretically, for an operation to be thoroughly tested, the test case should
traverse all the combinations of routes in the code. In <strong>member</strong>,
there are three alternative routes inside the <strong>while-loop</strong>. The
test case can traverse the loop either several times or not at all. If the test
case does not traverse the loop at all, you will find only one route through the
code. If it traverses the loop once, you will find three routes. If it traverses
twice, you will find six routes, and so forth. Thus, the total number of routes
will be 1+3+6+12+24+48+, which in practice, is an unmanageable number of
route combinations. That is why you must choose a subset of all these routes. In
this example, you can use two test cases to execute all the statements. In one
test case, you might choose <strong>Set of Integers</strong> = {1,5,7,8,11} and <strong>t</strong>
= 3 as test data. In the other test case, you might choose <strong>Set of
Integers</strong> = {1,5,7,8,11} and <strong>t</strong> = 8.</p>

<p>The purpose of a black-box test is to verify the unit's specified behavior
without looking at <strong>how </strong>the unit implements that behavior.
Black-box tests focus and rely upon the unit's input and output.</p>
<p><strong>Equivalence partitioning</strong><b> </b>is a technique for reducing
the required number of tests.<b> </b>For every operation, you should identify
the equivalence classes of the arguments and the object states. An <strong>equivalence
class</strong> is a set of values for which an object is supposed to behave
similarly. For example, a <strong>Set</strong> has three equivalence classes: <strong>empty</strong>,
<strong>some element, </strong>and<strong> full</strong>.</p>
<p>Use code-coverage tools to identify the code not exercised by your white box
testing. Reliability testing should be done simultaneously with your black-box
testing.</p>
<p>The next two subsections describe how to identify test cases by selecting
test data for specific arguments.</p>
<h5>Test Cases based upon Input Arguments</h5>
<p>An <strong>input argument </strong>is an argument used by an operation. You
should create test cases by using input arguments for each operation, for each
of the following input conditions:&nbsp;
</p><ul>
  <li>Normal values from each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values on the boundary of each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values outside the equivalence classes.</li>
  <li>Illegal values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to treat the object state as an input argument. If, for example, you
test an operation <strong>add </strong>on an object <strong>Set</strong>, you
must test <strong>add </strong>with values from all of <strong>Set</strong>'s
equivalence classes, that is, with a full <strong>Set</strong>, with some
element in <strong>Set, </strong>and with an empty<strong> Set</strong>.</p>
<h5>Test Cases based upon Output Arguments</h5>
<p>An <strong>output argument</strong> is an argument that an operation changes.
An argument can be both an input and an output argument. Select input so that
you get <strong>output</strong> according to each of the following.
</p><ul>
  <li>Normal values from each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values on the boundary for each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values outside the equivalence classes.</li>
  <li>Illegal values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to treat the object state as an output argument. If for example, you
test an operation <strong>remove</strong> on a <strong>List</strong>, you must
choose input values so that <strong>List</strong> is full, has some element, and
is empty after the operation is performed (test with values from all its
equivalence classes).</p>
<p>If the object is state-controlled (reacts differently depending on the
object's state), you should use a state matrix such as the one in the following
figure.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="./RUP_Guidelines_Test Case_files/untst002.gif" width="184" height="166"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A state matrix for testing. You can test all combinations
of state and stimuli on the basis of this matrix.</p>

<p>Product acceptance testing is the final test action prior to deploying the
software. The goal of acceptance testing is to verify that the software is ready
and can be used by the end-users to perform those functions and tasks the
software was built to do. Product acceptance testing often involves more than
execution of the software for readiness, it also involves all product artifacts
delivered to the customer(s), such as training, documentation, and
packaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deriving test cases for the software artifact(s) is done in the manner
described in the sections above. Depending upon the degree and of formality of
the product acceptance test, the test cases will either be the same or similar
to those identified above (formal), or a sub-set (informal). Independent of the
depth of the test cases, agreement on the test cases and <a href="http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/artifact/ar_acpl.htm" "="">Product
Acceptance Plan</a> should be reached at before product testing is implemented
and executed.</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black"><font color="black">Evaluating the non-software
artifact(s) varies greatly dependent upon the artifact being evaluated. Refer to
each specific non-software artifacts Guidelines and Checklists for

<p>Regression testing compares two builds or versions of the same target-of-test
and identifies differences as potential defects. It thus assumes that a new
version should behave like an earlier one and ensures that defects have not been
introduced as a result of the changes.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would like all the test cases in one iteration to be used as
test cases in the later iterations. The following guidelines should be used to
identify, design, and implement test cases that maximize the value of regression
testing and re-use, while minimizing maintenance:
</p><ul>
  <li>Ensure the test case identify only the critical data elements (those
    needed to create / support the condition being tested</li>
  <li>Ensure each test case describes or represents a unique set of inputs or
    sequence of events that results in a unique behavior by the target-of-test</li>
  <li>Eliminate redundant or equivalent test cases</li>
  <li>Group together test cases which have the same target-of-test initial state
    and state of the test data</li>
</ul>
