I. FOR JUNIT TEST in PC - WINDOWS
1a. Download and unzip Ant, or get it from Google shared folders sqat/slides/UT/tools/ folder
Download and install JDK 1.6 build 30, or get it from Google shared folders sqat/slides/UT/tools/ folder

1b. Open system variable:
MyComputer> Property > SystemProperty> Tab Advanced > Environment Variables > System variable

2. Add variables
At System variables
New...> ANT_HOME <path to ant folder, ex: C:\_Data\_setup\pc\apache-ant-1.8.4>
New...> JAVA_HOME <path to java folder, ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_30>

3. Edit Path
System Variables > Path > edit> add the string of ";%ANT_HOME%/bin;%JAVA_HOME%/bin"
Save

4. Test Ant, Javac after configuration
Start>cmd
type: ant (enter)
system replies if ANT is installed ok:
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed
-> it is ok

Start>cmd
type: javac
system replies if JDK is installed ok:
Usage: javac <options> <source files>
…-> it is ok

5. Go to folder junit samples by typing: cd <your folder>

6. At junitsamples folder, type: “ant clean” -> to clean the old compiled data
Type: “ant compile” -> to compile the source code: math.java, and testmath.java
Type: “ant test” -> to runtest testmath.java class against math.java, and report HTML. Go to /report folder to view report HTML.

7. View math.java, and testmath.java to know how junit run.

8. Then, do some assignment.

II. FOR JUNIT TEST in MAC
1. Make sure you have Java SDK 1.6.x for Mac (download from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US) default installed on your mac. Check it by command lines:
In Launchpad>Terminal> type “java -version” -> it returns something like: java version “1.6.xxxx" -> it is ok
In Launchpad>Terminal> type “javac” ->should return Usage: javac <options> <source files>
-> it is ok
If not, go to this LINK to download suitable a 1.6.x version for mac: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. Then set JAVA_HOME, in Launchpad>Terminal> type” export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home` “

2. Download and unzip Ant (http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi), or get it from Google shared folders sqat/slides/UT/tools/ folder. Assuming to unzip to documents/apache-ant-1.8.4/bin folder. If using JDK 1.8, so Ant 1.9.x should be considered 

3. In Launchpad>Terminal> type” export PATH=/Users/phamtuananh/Documents/_FU/apache-ant-1.8.4/bin:"$PATH" “
or 


4. In Launchpad>Terminal> type”ant -version” -> should be returned: Apache Ant(TM) version 1.8.4 compiled on May 22 2012 -> it is ok

5. Go to folder junit samples by typing: cd <your folder>

6. At junitsamples folder, type: “ant clean” -> to clean the old compiled data
Type: “ant compile” -> to compile the source code: math.java, and testmath.java
Type: “ant test” -> to runtest testmath.java class against math.java, and report HTML. Go to /report folder to view report HTML.

7. View math.java, and testmath.java to know how junit run.

8. Then, do some assignment.
